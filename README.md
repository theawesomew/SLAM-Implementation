# SLAM-Implementation

This repository seeks to implement a SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping) algorithm utilising EKF (extended Kalman filter) in Python. The associated robot is custom-built using a Raspberry PI 4 as its microcontroller and uses an Intel RealSense LiDAR Camera L515 for its vision.

The custom-built robot moves approximately 15 cm per character in its 'program string'
